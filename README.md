#### Summary:

All of the gender based figures show that males are the largest customer base and that they typically use the bikes to commute too and from work.  The female customers typically keep the bike for a longer period of time and typically use the bike to commute too and from work but there are fewer of them.  We can also see that the both genders are typically annual subscribers.  Two additional visualizations that could help to better focus advertising are listed and described below.

* Better defining of both genders' demographic.
  * This could be accomplished by adding visualizations utilizing age, frequency and duration to show how age and gender define the best customers.

* Determine most traveled routes during checkout for each gender.
  * Increasing the female customer base could be beneficial since they have a longer typical trip duration than males.  The placement of advertising along the typical routes taken by female customers could help to achieve this.
